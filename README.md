# NSIDC Glacier Photograph Collection

## Description
The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado has a collection of Glacier Photographs that consists of roughly 30,000 photographs of glaciers, mostly taken in the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Greenland. Photographs were taken from both the air and the ground with a date range from the 1890s to the 1980s. The collection also includes a smaller number of photographs of glaciers in Europe, South America, the Himalayas, and Antarctica. These images constitute an important historical record, as well as a data collection of interest to those studying the response of glaciers to climate change. This digital collection consists of a selection of images from the collection. For more information about the NSIDC data, please see Glacier Photograph Collection, Version 1.

## Metadata
Metadata fields for the NSIDC Glacier Photograph Collection:

### Identifier
A unique identifier for the digital surrogate of the photographic print or digital born photograph. See the File Naming Convention. This field was called Photo ID during the pre-grant phase. naidc_glacierPhotos_ is prefix, second part of identifier is constructed according to different methods, depending on the phase of the project.
### IdentifierLink
Linking information for the identifier. [may be blank]
### Identifier ARK
ARK identifier for the resource in the University of Colorado Libraries database. Controlled with the ARK server. [Permanent identifier]
### Identifier LUNA
Identifier for the resource in the LUNA software. [May be retired after migration to a new platform.]
### Title
The name of glacier, state/province, and/or Aerial Flight number, and may contain the assigned archive number for the photograph collection & subseries.
### TitleLink
Linking information for the title. [may be blank]
### Creator
Name of the photographer who took the photo. If the full name is known then it is used, otherwise first and/or middle initials are used. If the photographer name is not known, it is set to Unidentified. Role is included after the creator's name (Post, Austin, photographer). 
### CreatorLink
Linked data information for the creator, if controllable. [may be blank]
### Publisher
The entity or organization that published the photographs.
### PublisherLink
Linked data information for the publisher. [may be blank]
### Date
Date the photograph was taken. If no date was provided, list as Undated.
### DateLink
Linking information for the date. [may be blank]
### Extent
Extent of the item. Number of photographs, and dimensions in cm. and in. provided.

Examples:

1 photoprint; 20.3 x 12.7 cm (8 x 5 inches)

1 photoprint

1 color slide; 35 mm

2 pages

### Format
Format of the item. Control with AAT terms. See metadata for examples.
### FormatLink
URI for the format.
### Description
Annotations and notes transcribed from the photographs as well as cataloger's notes. Further physical description & measurement of the original media.
### DescriptionLink	
Linking information for the Description [may be blank]
### Glacier Name
The name of the glacier, if known. If the name is Unknown then Unknown is used. If the photograph does not actually contain a glacier then it is labeled as No Glacier. Controlled name for the glacier is derived from GNIS, NGA GeoNames, a local names gazetteer, or one of the scientific databases. In rare cases, the names were derived from the labels on the photographs. The name used in this field is the authorized version, logged in the Glacier Index. Notes about variant names or spellings used for the glacier pictured may appear in the Description field for those photographs.
### Glacier Latitude
Latitude of the primary glacier in the photograph. Coordinates are derived from an authoritative source, either GNIS, NGA GeoNames, a particular country's name authority board, GLIMS, or in rare cases, from notes on the photograph.
### Glacier Longitude
Longitude of the primary glacier in the photograph. Coordinates are derived from an authoritative source, either GNIS, NGA GeoNames, a particular country's name authority board, GLIMS, or in rare cases, from notes on the photograph.
### GLIMS Glacier ID
GLIMS (Global Land Ice Measurements from Space) Identification numbers are assigned by a group of glaciologists and are used for identification in their scientific work. GLIMS ID often correlates with a known glacier name. Information was retrieved from the GLIMS database. Additional information can be found on https://www.glims.org/
### Coverage Spatial
A data value standard using a controlled index that provides preferred coverage for the glaciers. Place names include name for nations, inhabited places, and physical features (glaciers, mountains, etc.). Format is generally *Place Name (Second Order Administrative Division, First Order Administrative Division, Country, Continent) (feature type)*
- Feature type derived from TGN, except when the location was not listed in TGN, then either an analogous TGN term or the term from the resource was used.

## Notes
Many of the names and descriptions in this data set contain diacritical marks and symbols that are UTF-8 encoded. When opening this data, please be aware that programs like Excel do not handle these well unless the encoding type is specified on import. The team working on this data found that we had the fewest issues when working in Google Sheets. If manipulating the data in other programs, including OpenRefine, be sure to specify UTF-8 encoding.

The schema for this collection is based on Dublin Core and the Glacier Photograph Collection (NSIDC) schema, which was driven by requirements from the glaciology community.
